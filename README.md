# Student-Market-Place-Android-Application

About the Application:
-----------------------------
There is a constant need for SU students to buy or sell items when they move-in or move-out to different cities. 
In fact, there are many existing android applications, that serve this purpose. 
However, these apps pose identity-theft issues. For instance, a person tries to buy an item from someone, however, the seller does not exist at all since the seller has posted items for sale on a fake id. Therefore, on this occasion, trust factor is compromised here, posing huge problems for the prospective buyers and sellers. Hence, we have come up with an app – ‘Student Market Place’, where SU students exclusively can buy/sell items. By having SU students buy/sell items, we ensure that items are bought from trust-worthy source and prospective buyers/seller can safely trade off the items. Not only SU students, but also non-SU students can also use this application, provided SU students refer these non-SU students as well. 
In this way, trust factor is leveraged to non-SU students as well.

Features:
--------------
The application provides the features of adding, viewing and browsing the products, authorizing the buyers and sellers, viewing the most trending products in the user’s location, and locate the area where the product is sold.
